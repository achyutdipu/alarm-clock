This is my alarm clock.
    It consists of:
        A sound for the alarm clock,
        A font for the alarm clock,
        Files for the alarm clock:
            in HTML,
            in CSS,
            and in Javascirpt.
    In order to set the alarm clock, all you have to do is press "Set Alarm" and chose what time you want.
